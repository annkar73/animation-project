**A small school project to animate a svg-file.**  
A work currently in progress... 

Two different script-files to alternate between a chaotic animation and a wave, depending on what I decide is more fun (currently a wave).  
Still a few glitches since id's for some reason can not be found and insist on returning as null so nothing happens, but the same code works on CodePen for some reason:
